# Cryptocurrencies API Example ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

This is a basic pet project for using a cryptocurrency API with Angular and Netlify ðŸš€. I know there are some mistakes like not using strict mode (I'm currently learning Angular) or variable names, but I just wanted to learn the way to deploy on Netlify and a basic usage of the framework. There are also some errors related with the language, because sometimes I use Spanish and in other cases I use English.
