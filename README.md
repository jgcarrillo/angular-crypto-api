# Cryptocurrencies API Example 💰💰

This is a basic pet project for using a cryptocurrency API with Angular and Netlify 🚀. I know there are some mistakes like not using strict mode (I'm currently learning Angular) or variable names, but I just wanted to learn the way to deploy on Netlify and a basic usage of the framework. There are also some errors related with the language, because sometimes I use Spanish and in other cases I use English.

Features ⭐

- Basic use of the services to call the **CoinGecko API.**
- Implement basic routing.
- Basic filter by pattern.
- Specific filter for favourite coins so you can add some coins into your wallet and then you can remove them and also see more details.

Future improvements 🔨

- Use strict mode.
- Better nomenclature of variables.
- Implement more filters by price of something like that.
