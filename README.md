# Cryptocurrency API Example ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

This is a basic pet project for using a cryptocurrency API with Angular and Netlify. I know there are some mistakes like not using strict mode (I'm currently learning Angular) or variable names, but I just wanted to learn the way to deploy on Netlify and a basic usage of the framework. There are also some errors related with the language, because sometimes I use Spanish and in other cases I use English.

## ðŸŽ¨ Features

- Basic use of the services to call the **CoinGecko API.**
- Implement basic routing.
- Basic filter by pattern.
- Specific filter for favourite coins so you can add some coins into your wallet and then you can remove them and also see more details.

## ðŸ”¨ Future improvements

- Use strict mode.
- Better nomenclature of variables.
- Implement more filters by price of something like that.

## ðŸš€ Netlify Deploy

For a future use it is simply to deploy an Angular web to Netlify. You just need to create a **Github repository** and then authorize Netlify to connect to it. You just need to change the **Build command:** to `ng build --prod` and the **Publish directory:** to `the name of the folder for your Angular project locally`.

To know that you can run `ng build --prod` and check the folder Angular has created. The publish directory will be `dist/{your-angular-folder-name}`.
